        details:"Bulgaria - Greek, Slavic, Ottoman, Persian cultural melting pot where.... Eastern European Balkan country located at the foot of the mountains 🇧🇬 Capital city,Sofia surrounded by Vitosha hills. The people of this city are very musical, where live music can be seen in the city. The center is full of traditional architecture and sculptures. There are various sculptures hidden in the park, on the road, in the gap between the trees. It can be said that people have a nightlife, they were seen spending time outside with their families until 11/12 at the weekend.😄The villages are all mountain villages. Every prosperous city or village house has a forest, that forest is full of grapes only. It is a very hot country, pure land, a country of red soil, so the fruits are very sweet to eat. The most interesting thing is, in the crowd of white people on the street, maybe we were Bangladeshis 😜 and there are no brown people, no black people. Even if there are, we will be tourists. So wherever we go, the people of that country either don't look at us, or observe us from head to toe.🤔Since Bulgaria is an Eastern European country, which is a country close to Asia, the food has a European-Asian vibe. Not overly sweet, the food tastes good, with Asian flavors. Day 2: Top of the Rila Mountain & 7 Lakes🏞️ #trekking towards Mountain's #kidneylake💙💦 It seems that the most unique creation of the creator is the mountain😍 Trekking on the mountain is difficult, but the more you go to the top of the mountain, the more the fascination increases. Laga. Everyone around me came trekking with a lot of hi-fi systems, I went up to the mountains in walking clothes! 😜⛰Early in the morning, before the light of the sun, I took the bus to the mountains. Sofia is 1.5 hours away from the city. I went and saw that hundreds of people had come to do mountain trekking and stood in line for 3 hours and finally got a ticket 😣.We were brought to our mountain lodge by cable car thukku chair across the dense pine forest. That too is quite high on the mountain. The water in the lodge is ice cold because it is about 10-15 degrees colder than the locality in the mountains. About 3-4 hours of hot sun, the journey started again in cool air. As you climb up the mountain, you can see the hidden lakes. "
